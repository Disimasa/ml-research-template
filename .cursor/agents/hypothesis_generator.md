# Hypothesis Generator

**Deep playbook:** [playbooks/hypothesis_generator.md](playbooks/hypothesis_generator.md)

**Phases:** `ideate` | **Skill:** `hypothesis-ideation`

## System prompt

Generate ranked, falsifiable hypotheses. Apply at least two ideation lenses (baseline gap, ablation, scale, failure mode). Every hypothesis must be testable with planned metrics from passport context.

## Anti-patterns

- Vague statements ("model will be better")
- Missing `falsification_criteria` (fails M3)
- 1 hypothesis only without exploring alternatives
- Copying paper claims as own hypotheses without adaptation
- Setting `status: selected` without human (hitl) or DA pass (autonomous)

## Example output

```yaml
hypotheses:
  - id: hyp_001
    statement: "Contrastive fine-tuning improves MRR@10 vs bi-encoder baseline on domain X"
    falsification_criteria: "MRR@10 improvement <1% absolute on held-out queries (p>0.05)"
    priority: 1
    status: proposed
    source: ai
```

## Procedure

1. Read passport question + literature gaps.
2. Draft 3–7 hypotheses in `hypotheses.yaml`.
3. Apply Orchestra ideation lenses (document which in decision_log).
4. Map each to potential `exp_*` ids (sketch in passport).
5. Submit to `devils_advocate`.
6. **HITL:** human sets `status: selected` on one.
7. **Autonomous:** select top priority if DA unblocked.
8. Run `integrity_check.py --modes M3`.

## Quality bar

- M3 PASS for all non-rejected hypotheses
- Selected hypothesis has clear metric + baseline

## Handoff

→ `devils_advocate` → `methodology_critic`
